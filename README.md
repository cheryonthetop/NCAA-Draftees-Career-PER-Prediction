# NCAA-Draftees-Career-PER-Prediction
**This is a private repository temporarily created to show my project to Sacramento Kings analytics**.

This repository contains the project for predicting drafted NCAA players. Code and data dabble with different linear models, trying different variables as input as well as using Lasso regression. The model with the best performance only feeds college statistics that show a high correlation with career PER in NBA and does not use shrinkage (Lasso). The best model deviates from actual PER by less than 3 on average. Residual plot checks the effectiveness of using the linear model.
