# NCAA-Draftees-Career-PER-Prediction
This repository contains the project for predicting drafted NCAA players. Code and data dabble with different linear models, trying different variables as input as well as using Lasso regression. Input variables include different college statistics with a high enough correlation with PER. The model with the best performance only feeds college statistics that show a high correlation with career PER in NBA and does not use shrinkage (Lasso). Residual plot checks the effectiveness of using the linear model.
